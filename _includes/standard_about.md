OEMR is a non-profit organization formed to ensure that all people, regardless of race, socioeconomic status or geographic location, have access to high-quality medical care through the donation of free, open source medical software and service relating to that software.

OEMR supports the OpenEMR project and uses OpenEMR software as the primary instrument to effect its goals. OEMR has an open policy for membership and accepts donations (PayPal link below).

OpenEMR is an electronic health records and medical practice management application. It features fully integrated electronic health, records, practice management, scheduling, electronic billing.

Why OpenEMR? Well, “one size fits all” does not apply to your patients, and it certainly doesn’t apply to your staff, your workflow, and your infrastructure. OEMR promotes OpenEMR software because it is the EMR for everyone. It is endlessly configurable to suit you needs. You will own and control the program and the data yourself. You can securely access your data from anywhere. Large institutions, small practices, and even lone therapists can all benefit from the same powerful features.
