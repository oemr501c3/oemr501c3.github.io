## Electronic Medical Records
An electronic medical record is a digital representation of a patientâ€™s medical history. An EMR allows providers to efficently track data over time, identify patients who are due for preventive visits and screenings, monitor how patients measure up to certain parameters such as vaccinations and blood pressure readings, and improve overall quality of care in a practice. The goals of EMR Adoption includes access to accurate and complete information about a patient's health, ability to quickly provide care when needed, ability to better coordinate care, and allow sharing of medical information with patients and their family.
