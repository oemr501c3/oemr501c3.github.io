## Overview

## Code Development
There are a myriad of code development learning opportunities.

By coupling mentorship by OEMR to the OpenEMR project, the opportunities for learning are vast. Since OpenEMR is actively used software, it provides an opportunity to learn these tools while also producing something meaningful. The main development languages and tools involved in the OpenEMR project are PHP, mysql/mariadb, javascript, html and git. Other less used languages and tools involved in OpenEMR are perl, bash, python, Zend framework, and Smarty framework.
